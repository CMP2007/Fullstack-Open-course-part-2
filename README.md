## My process

### What I learned

While this is not the first time I've emulated a server for testing, it is the first time I've done it with the json-server tool, so far I feel like I have a good understanding of the principles of requests and promises.

The biggest challenge I've encountered so far is mainly based on my logic when structuring the code, this is because I'm still getting used to React's immutability principle and its component-based structure.
